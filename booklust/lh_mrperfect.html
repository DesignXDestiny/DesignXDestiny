            <ol>
                <li>Faithfulness: no cheating, no liying.</li>
                <li>Nice: No one wants to spend their life with a jerk.</li>
                <li>Dependable</li>
                <li>Steady Job: shows responsibility and maturity</li>
                <li>Humor: sense of, in all fairness form of humor cannot be dictated.</li>
                <li>Financially Comfortable: Comfortable amount of money, not too much so he is not used to "calling the shots".</li>
                <li>Aesthetically pleasing , phyisically.</li>  
                <li>In Bed: Enthusiasm, & stamina. 8" is plenty, any more (10") is only show and tell, leftovers.</li>
