            <h3>Analysis &amp; Review</h3>

                <h5>Positive!</h5>
                   <p>
                          This story feels very real by taking you away to a small town, 
                          with hunting.
                          Joe's moral compass is ideal, he is very heroic. 
                          <br>
                          This is expressed in different ways as he is put in different situations.
                      </p>    

                        <p>
                            This is a very interesting part of the story. 
                            There is this whole bit where Joe is thinking that if people had a finite quantity of words to speak in their lifetime,
                            then their words would be more valueable.
                            People who say much,
                            but nothing of value, 
                            would be silent. 
                             <br>
                            In Joe's imagination,
                            those people ran out of their alloted quantity of words.
                        </p>
                            
                        <p>    
                          Constantly you can feel Joe's need, strain to provide for his family. 
                          Women are flung at him, instead of breaking his vowes,
                          he acts like they/she is somebody's daughter/wife.
                           <br>
                          His loyalties are shown in his choices at work and home.




                    </p>

                  <h5>Critically</h5>

                    <p>
                          The plot though it is good,
                           needs a few twists.
                           I wanted more of an <i>Ah-ha!</i> moment.
                           This book should never be in the mysteries section,
                            don't read it for suspense value. 
                            After I was about 30 pages in, to around 150,
                            I was just waiting for Joe to figure out what was made obvious to me.
                            This novel left me wanting for a puzzle to put together,
                            there was a satisfaction missing from overcoming that challenge.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                          Another separate point, 
                          it was difficult to discern the time that the book was set in.
                                <br>
                            My first clue was about half way in when a woman was wearig jeans, 
                            signaling that society was beyond skirts all the time.
                            Second clue, 
                            the charachters use land-line phones when the plot really gets going.
                            The third is that at the end of the book, 
                            a cell phone is offered with a job promotion.
                                  <br>
                          I would have liked there to be a signal earlier in the text.
                          This is the first book to a whole series, 
                          so the author may as well let the reader know.

        <h3 id="sum">Summary</h3>
        <h4>SPOILER  ALERT!</h4>
        <h5>Read if you need cliff notes or need to be able to talk as if youv'e read the book, when you in fact did not make time to do that.</h5>

            <p>


                    Joe Pickett (main) is a Game Warden in Wyoming,
                    with Marybeth (his wife) who is pregnant and raising their two daughtrers. 
                    Sheridan is the eldest (7 years old), Lucy is the youngest.
              </p>

                <p>
                    Joe ticketed a poacher while he (Joe) was on duty,
                     named Ote Keely.
                     That person, Keely shows up on Joe's back porch.
                     Joe discovers him when Sheridan becomes frightened of monsters,
                     claiming she saw them out there.
                     Ote is shot, dead.
                         <br>
                     The men Ote was out camping with when this happened were found shoot dead as well,
                     just not on Joe's back porch.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                      Vern Dungan, thinking that everyone owes him favors,
                      is making an attempt at a scheme to put in a (pipe) line,
                      which would transport resorces from there to California.
                      Vern seems to be under the impression that he can make a large profit off of this project.
                      Joe seems to be getting jerked around at work a lot,
                      seems like office politics, and needs to provide for his family on his $27,000/salary.
                      Purse strings are tight.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                      A family of small animals is found in the wood pile in the backyard by Sheridan.
                      She feeds them things like cherios,
                      and keeps them as her <i>"secret pets".</i>
                        <br>
                      Wacey, a cop who is running for sherriff, 
                      and who Joe thinks of as a friend,
                      is threatening Sheridan.
                      He tells her that he will kill her family if she doesn't keep those animals in her backyard secret.
                      She is afraid to talk to her parents, or anyone about these threats, or secrets.

                        <br>
                        Wacey ends up shooting the mom,
                         Marybeth and she loses the baby anyway. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <i>"Miller Weasles"</i> 
                        were thought to be extinct.
                        Ote and the men he had been camping with had discovered some that were alive.
                        Ote was attempting to bring some to Joe to present to him as Game Warden,
                        when he was shot to death in Joe's backyard.
                        The weasles escaped Ote's lunch box and began living in Joe's backyard as Sheridan's secret pets.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Vern and Wacey were not able to make all of that money that they were dreaming of,
                     off of that line to California.  
                     Once Joe found out about all of their deeds,
                     not only were they incarserated, 
                     but also as they had feared,
                     the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), 
                     and similar organizations got involved who took action to preserve the endangered wildlife that had been discovered and reported.
                     They blocked off a large area of land just to ensure the survival of the species by conserving their habitat.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Joe ends up shooting both Wacy and Vern around his home.
                    He did not kill either of them but did get a raise for his job and a cellular telephone.  
                    Throughout the rest of the book they had used landlines.
