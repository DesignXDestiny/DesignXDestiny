                I enjoy a wide range of variety of book, Fiction, or non-fiction. 
                I admire peoples' ideas, like to share my own, and truly appreciate the way people can organize their larger ideas and share them, similar to the way we use the Internet. 
                Perhaps the <em>library</em> is the back up, in case of Google-apocalypse.

                  <p><b>This feature is coming soon to the web page.</b>
                    <br>
                    I attended the College of Southern Nevada, covering general education courses, traditional art, graphics, & Web. 
                    <br>
                    This is where my interest in coding and building websites from scratch started. My fascination with drawing pictures from observation was easily transferable to Graphic mediums. 
                    I invite challenges.

                    This is an assignment from a class I took in College.  This is an example of what kind of coding I am capable of. It includes site navigation media queries, CSS3, HTML5, and a bit of JavaScript.  I am using web fonts. I made any graphics myself, and or crated (gradients using Cascading Style Sheets).

                       Naturally always having an interest in technology and what I was studying to make the worlds of drawing and computeres come together <b>(ADOBE)</b>, I wrote this essay, then used it as the content for a website.  The background is a repeating image of a blank scanned in page of my note book from that semester.
