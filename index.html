                  <p><b>This feature is coming soon to the web page.</b>
                    <br>
                    I attended the College of Southern Nevada, covering general education courses, traditional art, graphics, & Web. 
                    <br>
                    This is where my interest in coding and building websites from scratch started. My facination with drawing pictures from observation was easily transferable to Graphic mediums. 
                    I invite challenges.

                  <p>
                    This is an assignment from a class I took in College.  This is an example of what kind of coding I am capable of. It includes site navigation media queries, CSS3, HTML5, and a bit of JavaScript.  I am using web fonts. I made any graphics myself, and or crated (gradients using Cascading Style Sheets).

                       Naturally always having an interest in technology and what I was studying to make the worlds of drawing and computeres come together <b>(ADOBE)</b>, I wrote this essay, then used it as the content for a website.  The background is a repeating image of a blank scanned in page of my note book from that semester. 
                       <br>Enjoy.
