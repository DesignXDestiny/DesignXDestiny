		<h2>CSS Pre-Processors</h2>
			<p><span>May 2021</span><br>
				I am adding CSS preprocessing to my workflow.  
				I am learning an important part of what is required for creating dynamic websites that are compatible with multiple browsers. 
				Cascading Style Sheets and I have been well acquainted for years. 
				The main CSS file for my website is about 900 lines of code. 
				I have been diligent in my attention to detail skills, like finding the missing tag(s) and code breaking culprits. 
				As many times as this style sheet validates, there are still unintentional cross-browser differences.
			</p>
		<div id="sass">
		<h4>SASS &amp; SCSS</h4>
			<p>
				Now I'm exploring SASS and SCSS to overcome the challenge of cross-browser compatibility checking, and some functionality in an efficient way. 
				<em>This page was styled using SASS.</em> In SCSS, Erlenmeyer brackets and semi-colons are still used, similar to traditional CSS. 
				I chose this over other preprocessors for online support. 
				I appreciate it when other people have already asked, answered questions, and made tutorials.

		<h2>Google Analytics</h2>
		<iframe src="../images/cert/Course_Certificate.pdf"></iframe>
		<p><span>April 2021</span><br>
			Google Analytics for Beginners, to make sure that I wasn't missing anything.
			 I've been using <em>Google Analytics</em> for 
			<span><a href="https//wwww.DesignXDestiny.com">wwww.DesignXDestiny.com</a></span> 
			since I put it up in February 2019. 
			It is great being able to know who is looking around my site, where they came from, and when.
			This is anespecially useful tool when I dive into improving my website, it gives my drafting direction.
			Search Engine Optomization is a broad buzz-word term, what I am doing is part of that.
			A website is often a means to solve business "problems".

		<h2>Git</h2>

		<p><span>March 2021</span><br>
			I decided that I ought to be able to use git like other devs so that I am not missing anything.
			 Git is compatible with my Mac OS terminal and git hub. 
			 It also works with my external server, IONOS where I keep my website hosted. 
			 The login process is very similar. 
			 My computer doesn't like for me to upload the same repo to both places, 
			 so I still end up doing it manually. 
			 One doesn't seem faster than the other because my computer is so slow to load- 
			 either on the 2009 MacBook Pro or 2014 MacMini. 
			 I am just hoping that this is useful elsewhere or on a better computer.
			 The terminal is useful as a different way of looking through my files, the finder is pretty slow.

		<h2>Markdown</h2>

		<p><span>February 2021</span><br>
			I wanted to learn how to keep track of and document my projects formally. 
			This Markup Language is used on Reddit, Git Hub, and Discord.
			This is some super-simplified cousin of HTML.

		<h3>Course Certificate</h3>
		<p><span>August 2020</span><br>
		   An HTML refresher couldn't hurt.
		   It is nice to have a certificate to show for it. 
		   This course is not very demanding, but it  is always good to  be reminded of the tags that I haven't used as much.
