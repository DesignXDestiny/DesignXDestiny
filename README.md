# Design X Destiny

## Description
This is _my website_ &amp; portfolio.


### About Author
My name is **Destiny Barrett**.
I went to College (*CSN*) in Las Vegas for Coding Design &amp; Art.  
Ofttimes I am in Las Vegas.  Sometimes Utah.  Other-times I'll be elsewhere.

Now that I have had a bunch of fun building this, I am continuing to build my site.

### Site Objectives
 1. Getting hired to create graphics, art, websites, something else someone thinks they could use me for.  The future is open.
<br> I intend to put myself in the business of making dreams come true.
 1. Its important to discover myself as an Artist, Designer, and Developer.    I want to challenge myself and push my limitations of mental, physical, and environmental nature to create something unique.  
 1. I need to develop my beliefs, views, and voice.  I'm not putting my heart and soul out there to be accepted, but to be challenged so we can all find higher truths.
